# magento2-get-disbaled-categories-and-delete-script
Script to get all disabled categories and delete them

- The script needs few adjustments before it works I don't want you do delete stuff you don't want to delete
- That's why there is a count 1st and a log file where you can see all the category ids and their count

# When you ready to delete the categories

- Remove the comments on in 37 if you want to you can comment the logger lines 39, 40
- you can run this script by placing it in the root of your magento 2 project 
- In the terminal run `php GetDisabledCategoriesAndDelete.php`
